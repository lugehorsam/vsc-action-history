Action History is a VS Code plugin that displays the actions an engineer has taken during a single VS Code session. // TODO define session

It is helpful for two aspects of an engineer's workflow:
- Viewing what actions can be undone or redone.
- Remembering what actions you were taking when you return to your computer (e.g., after a meeting, at the beginning of the workday).
